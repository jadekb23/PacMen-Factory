# PacMen-Factory

# Description
Another iteration of a take on the classic arcade game PacMan as an assignment part of the MITxPro: Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN course. Only this time the user can create as many PacMen avatars as they'd like and have them move across the screen as well. This project utilizes HTML, JavaScript, and some elements of CSS.

# Installation
Be sure to download all files listed in the repo as part of one directory to be sure that the game will run correctly. From there, drag and drop the the index.html file into your browser and enjoy!

# Usage 
When the page loads you will see two buttons "Add PacMan" and "Start Game". The first will populate a PacMan in the top left corner of the screen (you can generate as many as you'd like) and the second will prompt them to start moving at a randomized velocity, causing them to bounce back and forth on the screen. 
 
# Roadmap of Future Improvements 
I'd like to be able to integrate the actual mouth movements of the Pacmen, like in the real game, and possibly add in points or fruits for the user to interact with as well. Additionally, I would consider adding some background and styling elements to give it a more immersive feel.
